1. Copy this code:
javascript:var inputs = document.getElementsByClassName('uiButton _1sm'); 
for(var i=0; i<inputs.length;i++) { 
inputs[i].click(); 
}
2. Click "Invite friends to like this Page"
3. Scroll to the bottom of your friends until names stop loading
4. Once names stop loading right click on the text space where it says "Search all friends" and then click "Inspect element"
5. Click "Console" and paste the code with CTRL+V
(Note: Facebook has a warning on not to apply code there but if you read the code it doesn't do anything besides click the invite button)
6. Hit enter and wait. Depending on the size of your friends list this could take a few minutes.
